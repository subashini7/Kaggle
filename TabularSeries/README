Supervised classification/regression ML model training
1. Clean up missing values in the datasets
2. Plot the distribution of all the variables to understand bias in the datasets, as well as relationship w.r.t output
3. Evaluate Feature Engineering - addition/deletion of columns. 
4. Plot correlation, mutual information of the variables 
5. Evaluation metric adaptation for the given problem
6. ML model with SHAP or feature importance to determine which of the columns provide value to the training
7. Evaluate the trained model - Learning curves to determine over-fitting or under-fitting, Training and Test Set distributions to ensure that the performance will be similar in the leaderboard

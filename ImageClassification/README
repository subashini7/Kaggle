Supervised Image classification
1. Plot the distribution of all the classes
2. Image Augmentation 
3. Evaluation metric adaptation for the given problem
4. Train using an ImageNet based model + fine tuning 
5. Evaluate the trained model - Learning curves to determine over-fitting or under-fitting, Misclassification, Training and Test Set distributions to determine if any other type of augmentation would help
